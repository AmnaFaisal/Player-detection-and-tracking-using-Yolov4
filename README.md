# Player-detection-and-tracking-using-Yolov4
The following code uses YOLOv4, Deepsort and Tensorflow to implement object detection and tracking on mp4 format videos. Additionally, you can select a particular player, drop the rest and track him only for the rest of the video. The output is a .avi format video, with detection and tracking performed on it.
